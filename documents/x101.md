# Regular Expressions

## FLAGS

- `i` => ignores case.
- `g` => global flags : find more than first matching

## WILDCARD

- `.` => will match any one character
- `+` => sign to look for characters that occur one or more times. 1 and more
- `*` => will match any one character. 0 or more
- `?` =>
- `^` =>
- `$` =>
- `[ and ]` =>
- `|` =>
- `{ and }` => quantity specifiers.

## SHORTCUTS

- `\w` => this shortcut is equal to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`
- `\W` => this shortcut is equal to `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`.Match Everything But Letters and Numbers.
- `\d` => this is equal to the character class [0-9]
- `\D` => this is equal to the character class [^0-9]
- `\s` => match the whitespace or spaces between letters.

## `.test()`

Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

JavaScript has multiple ways to use regexes.One way to test a regex is using the `.test()` method. The `.test()` method takes the regex, applies it to a string (which is placed inside the parentheses), and returns `true` or `false` if your pattern finds something or not.

### **Literal Match**

```javascript
let string =
  "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.";

let regex = /write/;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);

console.log("isMatch", isMatch);
```

### **OR**

You can search for multiple patterns using the `alternation` or `OR` operator:`|`.

```javascript
let regex = /code|com/;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);
console.log("isOrMatch", isMatch);
```

### **Ignore case** `/ignorecase/i`

```javascript
let regex = /COmpUtEr|CoDe|wRite/i;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);
console.log("isOrMatch", isMatch);
```

## `.match()`

So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the `.match()` method.

To use the `.match()` method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

```javascript
let regex = /code/;
let isMatch = string.match(regex);
console.log("isMatch", isMatch);

// output
[
  'code',
  index: 19,
  input: 'Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.',
  groups: undefined
]
```

**Find More Than the First Match** `/more_match/g`

```javascript
let regex = /code/g;
let isMatch = string.match(regex);
console.log("isMatch", isMatch);

// output
["code", "code"];
```

**Match Anything with Wildcard Period**
The wildcard character `.` will match any one character. The wildcard is also called `dot` and `period`. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match `hug`, `huh`, `hut`, and `hum`, you can use the regex `/hu./` to match all four words.

```javascript
let hum = "I'll hum a song";
let hug = "Bear hug";
let regex = /hu./;
regex.test(hum);
regex.test(hug);
```

### **Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities** `[ and ]`

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[ and ]`) brackets.

```javascript
let big = "big";
let bag = "bag";
let bug = "bug";
let bog = "bog";
let regex = /b[aiu]g/;
big.match(regex);
bag.match(regex);
bug.match(regex);
bog.match(regex);
```

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: `-`.For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use `[a-e]`

```javascript
let cat = "cat";
let bat = "bat";
let mat = "mat";
let Regex = /[a-e]at/;
cat.match(Regex);
bat.match(Regex);
mat.match(Regex);

// output
[ 'cat', index: 0, input: 'cat', groups: undefined ]
[ 'bat', index: 0, input: 'bat', groups: undefined ]
null
```

### **Match Single Characters Not Specified in a characters set** `^`

you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called negated character sets.

To create a negated character set, you place a caret character (`^`) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

`/[^aeiou]/gi` matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like .`, !, [, @, /` and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

```javascript
let s = "9 strong mice.";
let regex = /[^0-9|aeiou]/gi;
let isMatch = s.match(regex);
console.log(isMatch);

// output
[" ", "s", "t", "r", "n", "g", " ", "m", "c", "."];
```

### **Match Beginning String Patterns** `^`

Outside of a character set, the caret `^` is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

```javascript
let string = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
let regex = /^Cal/;
console.log(regex.test(string));
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

### **Match Ending String Patterns** `^`

Outside of a character set, the caret `^` is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

```javascript
let string = "Cal and Ricky both like racing";
let regex = /racing$/;
console.log(regex.test(string));
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

### **Match Characters that Occur One or More Times**

Sometimes, you need to match a character (or group of characters) that appears one or more times in a row. This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.

You can use the `+` character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively.

```javascript
let s = "Mississippi";
let regex = /ss+/g;
console.log(s.match(regex));
```

There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

```javascript
let string = "gooooooooal!";
let goRegex = /go*/;
console.log(string.match(goRegex));

// output
[ 'goooooooo', index: 0, input: 'gooooooooal!', groups: undefined ]
```

### **Find Characters with Lazy Matching**

You can apply the regex `/t[a-z]*i/`to the string `"titanic"`. This regex is basically a pattern that starts with t, ends with i, and has some letters in between.Regular expressions are by default greedy, so the match would return `["titani"]`.

However, you can use the `?` character to change it to lazy matching. `"titanic"` matched against the adjusted regex of `/t[a-z]*?i/` returns `["ti"]`

```javascript
let string = "titanic";
let regex = /t[a-z]*i/;
let regexLazy = /t[a-z]*?i/;

console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regexLazy));

// output
[ 'titani', index: 0, input: 'titanic', groups: undefined ]
[ 'ti', index: 0, input: 'titanic', groups: undefined ]
```

### **Match All Letters and Numbers** with `\w`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\w/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regex).length);

// output
[
  "H",
  "o",
  "w",
  "v",
  "e",
  "x",
  "i",
  "n",
  "g",
  "l",
  "y",
  "q",
  "u",
  "i",
  "c",
  "k",
  "d",
  "a",
  "f",
  "t",
  "z",
  "e",
  "b",
  "r",
  "a",
  "s",
  "j",
  "u",
  "m",
  "p",
];
30;
```

### **Match Everything But Letters and Numbers** with `\W`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\W/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regex).length);
```

### **Match Whitespace or Expects** with `\s` and `\S`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\s/g;
let regexNotSpace = /\S/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regexNotSpace));
```

### Quantity specifiers

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets (`{` and `}`). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns

```javascript
let string = "Ohhhh no";
let regex = /oh{3,6}\sno/i;
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

```javascript
let regex = /ha{3,}h/;
```

To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

```javascript
let regex = /ha{3}h/;
```

### Check for All or None

ou can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark, `?`. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.

```javascript
let american = "color";
let british = "colour";
let regex = /colou?r/;
regex.test(american);
regex.test(british);
```

### **Positive and Negative Lookahead** with `(?=)` `(?!)`

Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.

There are two kinds of lookaheads: positive lookahead and negative lookahead.

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as `(?=...)` where the `...` is the required part that is not matched.

On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as `(?!...)` where the `...` is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.
