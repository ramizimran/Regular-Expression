# Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching and manipulating strings in JavaScript. They are created using forward slashes `/` and a combination of special characters, character classes, and metacharacters.

Some of the key features of regular expressions include:

- Character classes : These are used to match specific characters or ranges of characters. For example, \d will match any digit, while [A-Z] will match any uppercase letter.

- Quantifiers: These are used to specify how many times a character or group should be matched. For example, a\* will match zero or more "a" characters, while \d{3,5} will match three to five digits.

- Groups and ranges: These are used to group characters together and specify alternatives. For example, (abc)|(def) will match either "abc" or "def", while [A-Za-z] will match any letter.

- Anchors: These are used to match positions in the input string rather than specific characters. For example, ^ will match the start of the input string, while \b will match a word boundary.

## FLAGS

- `g` : The `g` flag stands for "global" and it causes the regular expression to be applied to all matches in the input string, rather than stopping at the first match.

- `i` : The `i` flag stands for "insensitive" and it causes the regular expression to be matched in a case-insensitive manner.

- `m` : The `m` flag stands for "multiline" and it causes the caret `^` and dollar sign `$` to match the start and end of a line, rather than the start and end of the input string. For example, the regular expression `/^abc$/m` will match `abc` if it appears at the start and end of a line.

- `s` : The `s` flag stands for "singleline" and it causes the period `.` to match any character, including a newline. For example, the regular expression `/.+/s` will match any character one or more times, including newlines.

- `x` : The `x` flag stands for "extended" and it allows you to use whitespace and comments inside the regular expression to make it more readable.

## CHARACTER CLASSES

- `\c` : is not a character class. It is a control escape that allows you to match a control character in a regular expression.

- `\s` : is a character class that matches any whitespace character (such as a space, tab, or newline).

- `\S` : is a character class that matches any non-whitespace character.

- `\d` : is a character class that matches any digit `[0-9]`.

- `\D` : is a character class that matches any non-digit character `[^0-9]`

- `\w` : is a character class that matches any alphanumeric character `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`

- `\W` : is a character class that matches any non-alphanumeric character `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`.

## ESCAPE CHARACTER

- `\`: The backslash `\` is used to escape special characters. For example, `\\` will match the backslash character literally.

- `\Q...\E`: The `\Q` and `\E` sequences are used to escape all characters between them. For example,`\Q[abc]\E` will match the characters `[abc]` literally.

## QUANTIFIERS

- `*` : is a preceding character, group, or character class can be matched zero or more times.

- `+` : is a preceding character, group, or character class must be matched one or more times.

- `?` : is a preceding character, group, or character class can be matched zero or one time.

- `{5}` : is a preceding character, group, or character class must be matched exactly five times.

- `{5,}` : is a preceding character, group, or character class must be matched at least five times.

- `1,5` : is a preceding character, group, or character class must be matched at least five times, but no more than nine times.

_note: Add a `?` to a quantifier to make it un-greedy._

## ANCHORS

- `^` : The caret `^` is an anchor that matches the start of the input string (or the start of a line if the `m` flag is set).

- `\A` : The `\A` anchor is similar to the caret `^`, but it only matches the absolute start of the input string, regardless of the `m` flag.

- `$` : The dollar sign `$` is an anchor that matches the end of the input string (or the end of a line if the `m` flag is set).

- `\Z` : The `\Z` anchor is similar to the dollar sign `$`, but it only matches the absolute end of the input string, regardless of the `m` flag

- `\b` : The `\b` anchor matches a word boundary. A word boundary is a position in the input string where a word character (as defined by the `\w` character class) is adjacent to a non-word character.

- `\B` : The `\B` anchor is the opposite of `\b`. It matches a position in the input string that is not a word boundary.

- `\<` : The `\<` anchor matches the start of a word.

- `\>`: The`\>` anchor matches the end of a word.

## GROUPS AND RANGES

- `.` :The period `.` is a special character that matches any single character (except for a newline).

- `a|b` : The vertical bar `|` is used to create a group of alternatives. For example, a|b will match either `a` or `b`.

- `(...)` : Parentheses are used to **group** characters together. For example, `(abc)` will match the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` in that order.

- `(?...)` : Parentheses with a question mark `?` are used to create a **non-capturing group**. This type of group is similar to a capturing group, but it does not capture the matched text.

- `[abc]` : Square brackets are used to create a character class. A character class will match any single character that is a member of the class. For example, `[abc]` will match any of the characters `a`, `b`, or `c`.

- `[^abc]` : A caret `^` placed inside square brackets negates the character class. For example, `[^abc]` will match any character that is not `a`, `b`, or `c`.

- `[a-z]` : A hyphen `-` inside square brackets is used to specify a range of characters. For example, `[a-z]` will match any lowercase letter.

  - `[A-Z]` will match any uppercase letter and

  - `[0-9]` will match any digit.

- `\x` : The backslash `\` is used to escape special characters. For example, `\x` will match the character `x` literally.

## ASSERTIONS

- `?=...` : A positive lookahead assertion. This type of assertion checks if the characters following the current position match the pattern inside the parentheses. If they do, the overall regular expression will match, but the characters inside the lookahead are not consumed.

- `?!...` : A negative lookahead assertion. This type of assertion checks if the characters following the current position do not match the pattern inside the parentheses. If they do not, the overall regular expression will match, but the characters inside the lookahead are not consumed.

- `?<=...` : A positive lookbehind assertion. This type of assertion checks if the characters preceding the current position match the pattern inside the parentheses. If they do, the overall regular expression will match, but the characters inside the lookbehind are not consumed.

- `?!=...`,`?<!...` : A negative lookbehind assertion. This type of assertion checks if the characters preceding the current position do not match the pattern inside the parentheses. If they do not, the overall regular expression will match, but the characters inside the lookbehind are not consumed.

- `?>...` : An independent group. This type of group is similar to a capturing group, but once it has matched a string, it will not backtrack to try and find a different match.

- A conditional group. This type of group allows you to specify different patterns to match based on a condition. The condition is specified inside the first set of parentheses, and the patterns to match are specified inside the second set of parentheses.

  - `?()` : Conditional `[if then]`

  - `?()|` : Conditional `[if then else]`

## QUICKSTART

Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching.

## `.test()`

The `test()` method is a method of the `RegExp` object that is used to test whether a string matches a regular expression. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the string matches the regular expression.

```javascript
const regex = /.../;
console.log(regex.test("..."));
console.log(regex.test("..."));
```

### **Literal Match**

```javascript
let string =
  "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.";

let regex = /write/;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);

console.log("isMatch", isMatch);
```

### **OR**

You can search for multiple patterns using the `alternation` or `OR` operator:`|`.

```javascript
let regex = /code|com/;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);
console.log("isOrMatch", isMatch);
```

### **Ignore Case** `/ignorecase/i`

```javascript
let regex = /COmpUtEr|CoDe|wRite/i;
let isMatch = regex.test(string);
console.log("isOrMatch", isMatch);
```

## `.match()`

The `.match()` method is a method of the `String` object that is used to match a string against a regular expression. It returns an array of matches, or `null` if no matches are found.

So far, you have only been checking if a pattern exists or not within a string. You can also extract the actual matches you found with the `.match()` method.

To use the `.match()` method, apply the method on a string and pass in the regex inside the parentheses.

```javascript
let regex = /code/;
let isMatch = string.match(regex);
console.log("isMatch", isMatch);

// output
[
  'code',
  index: 19,
  input: 'Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.',
  groups: undefined
]
```

### **Find More Than the First Match** `/more_match/g`

```javascript
let regex = /code/g;
let isMatch = string.match(regex);
console.log("isMatch", isMatch);

// output
["code", "code"];
```

### **Match Anything with Wildcard Period**

The wildcard character `.` will match any one character. The wildcard is also called `dot` and `period`. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match `hug`, `huh`, `hut`, and `hum`, you can use the regex `/hu./` to match all four words.

```javascript
let hum = "I'll hum a song";
let hug = "Bear hug";
let regex = /hu./;
regex.test(hum);
regex.test(hug);
```

### **Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities** `[ and ]`

You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square (`[ and ]`) brackets.

```javascript
let big = "big";
let bag = "bag";
let bug = "bug";
let bog = "bog";
let regex = /b[aiu]g/;
big.match(regex);
bag.match(regex);
bug.match(regex);
bog.match(regex);
```

Inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a hyphen character: `-`.For example, to match lowercase letters a through e you would use `[a-e]`

```javascript
let cat = "cat";
let bat = "bat";
let mat = "mat";
let Regex = /[a-e]at/;
cat.match(Regex);
bat.match(Regex);
mat.match(Regex);

// output
[ 'cat', index: 0, input: 'cat', groups: undefined ]
[ 'bat', index: 0, input: 'bat', groups: undefined ]
null
```

### **Match Single Characters Not Specified in a characters set** `^`

you could also create a set of characters that you do not want to match. These types of character sets are called negated character sets.

To create a negated character set, you place a caret character `^` after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match.

`/[^aeiou]/gi` matches all characters that are not a vowel. Note that characters like .`, !, [, @, /` and white space are matched - the negated vowel character set only excludes the vowel characters.

```javascript
let s = "9 strong mice.";
let regex = /[^0-9|aeiou]/gi;
let isMatch = s.match(regex);
console.log(isMatch);

// output
[" ", "s", "t", "r", "n", "g", " ", "m", "c", "."];
```

### **Match Beginning String Patterns** `^`

Outside of a character set, the caret `^` is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

```javascript
let string = "Cal and Ricky both like racing.";
let regex = /^Cal/;
console.log(regex.test(string));
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

### **Match Ending String Patterns** `^`

Outside of a character set, the caret `^` is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.

```javascript
let string = "Cal and Ricky both like racing";
let regex = /racing$/;
console.log(regex.test(string));
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

### **Match Characters that Occur One or More Times**

Sometimes, you need to match a character (or group of characters) that appears one or more times in a row. This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.

You can use the `+` character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively.

```javascript
let s = "Mississippi";
let regex = /ss+/g;
console.log(s.match(regex));

// output
["ss", "ss"];
```

There's also an option that matches characters that occur zero or more times.

```javascript
let string = "gooooooooal!";
let goRegex = /go*/;
console.log(string.match(goRegex));

// output
[ 'goooooooo', index: 0, input: 'gooooooooal!', groups: undefined ]
```

### **Find Characters with Lazy Matching**

In a regular expression, lazy matching is a way to match as few characters as possible while still satisfying the pattern. It is achieved by using the `U` flag, which stands for "ungreedy".

By default, quantifiers (such as `*`,`+`, and `?`) are "greedy" and will match as many characters as possible.

You can apply the regex `/t[a-z]*i/`to the string `"titanic"`. This regex is basically a pattern that starts with `t`, ends with `i`, and has some letters in between.Regular expressions are by default greedy, so the match would return `["titani"]`.

However, you can use the `?` character to change it to lazy matching. `"titanic"` matched against the adjusted regex of `/t[a-z]*?i/` returns `["ti"]`

```javascript
let string = "titanic";
let regex = /t[a-z]*i/;
let regexLazy = /t[a-z]*?i/;

console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regexLazy));

// output
[ 'titani', index: 0, input: 'titanic', groups: undefined ]
[ 'ti', index: 0, input: 'titanic', groups: undefined ] // matched first `ti`
```

### **Match All Letters and Numbers** with `\w`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\w/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regex).length);

// output
[
  "H",
  "o",
  "w",
  "v",
  "e",
  "x",
  "i",
  "n",
  "g",
  "l",
  "y",
  "q",
  "u",
  "i",
  "c",
  "k",
  "d",
  "a",
  "f",
  "t",
  "z",
  "e",
  "b",
  "r",
  "a",
  "s",
  "j",
  "u",
  "m",
  "p",
];

30;
```

### **Match Everything But Letters and Numbers** with `\W`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\W/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regex).length);
```

### **Match Whitespace or Expects** with `\s` and `\S`

```javascript
let string = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
let regex = /\s/g;
let regexNotSpace = /\S/g;
console.log(string.match(regex));
console.log(string.match(regexNotSpace));
```

### Quantity specifiers

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets (`{` and `}`). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns

```javascript
let string = "Ohhhh no";
let regex = /oh{3,6}\sno/i;
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

To only specify the lower number of patterns, keep the first number followed by a comma.

```javascript
let regex = /ha{3,}h/;
```

To specify a certain number of patterns, just have that one number between the curly brackets.

```javascript
let regex = /ha{3}h/;
```

### Check for All or None

ou can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark, `?`. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. You can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.

```javascript
let american = "color";
let british = "colour";
let regex = /colou?r/;

regex.test(american);
regex.test(british);
```

### **Positive and Negative Lookahead** with `(?=)` `(?!)`

Lookaheads are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.

There are two kinds of lookaheads: positive lookahead and negative lookahead.

A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won't actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as `(?=...)` where the `...` is the required part that is not matched.

On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as `(?!...)` where the `...` is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.

## **Check For Mixed Grouping of Characters** `()`

Sometimes we want to check for groups of characters using a Regular Expression and to achieve that we use parentheses ().

## Reuse Patterns Using Capture Groups

Capture groups are constructed by enclosing the regex pattern to be captured in parentheses. In this case, the goal is to capture a word consisting of alphanumeric characters so the capture group will be `\w+` enclosed by parentheses: `/(\w+)/`.

```javascript
let string = "row row row your boat";
let regex = /(\w+) \1 \1/;
console.log(regex.test(string));
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

The substring matched by the group is saved to a temporary "variable", which can be accessed within the same regex using a backslash and the number of the capture group (e.g. \1). Capture groups are automatically numbered by the position of their opening parentheses (left to right), starting at 1.
